Hey 
so I am working on a Big data Project 

my project is about handling dataset with pandas 
First we take data from Yfinance  - we have 4 tickers
then we process data - calculating monthly avg, min, max and ...
and then we aggrregiate the data - we make a seperate table by applying all filters and condition

so now i want to create a log file which recored the performance of my script 
i want to find the elasped time in each phase 
from the data downloading from yfaniance and then processing and then aggerating result

and then i want the total time elasped of my whole file and also how many entries were accected during whole project.
